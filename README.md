Exploring the different types of testing, including unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests using Jest and Puppeteer.

- The validate.test.js file inside tests folder contains an end-to-end test for one of my semester lab projects. It fully automates the process of inputting and testing the whole website using Puppeteer.

- The other tests and unit tests and small, except for one integration test in the validate.test.js file itself.
